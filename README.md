BitLicense-Amicus-Curiae
========================
A shared repository for drafting an Amicus Curiae Brief to the New York State Department of Financial Services about the proposed BitLicense regulations.

## How This Works
The NY Department of Financial Services has released [a draft of its so-called "BitLicense Regulations"](http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press2014/pr1407171-vc.pdf). These regulations are not friendly to small businesses and entreprenuers who would otherwise benefit from innovative uses of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

We have less than 45 days to inform the DFS about our concerns, and here's how:

ACE is running a crowdfunding campaign to cover the cost for a lawyer to draft what's referred to as an "Amicus Curiae Brief" -- basically, a structured argument, written in a format similar to legalese, that formally expresses our concerns. It is our belief that such a bold statement is much less likely to be ignored by the DFS.

We need source material to provide to the attorney, and that's where you come in! We're using Github as our collaborative platform for working with the community to capture arguments from the community at large about why the BitLicense regulations, as they are currently being proposed, need to be changed.

## What We Need
We need to gather the following:
1. A good list of references to draw from to make one or more structured arguments.
2. A list of the ways that the BitLicense regulations, as proposed, would detrimentally effect small businesses and entrepreneurs.
3. A list of the ways that the BitLicense regulations could be modified to address the concerns brought up in #2.

## How to Contribute
See GitHub's documentation on [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Basically, fork our repository, make changes, and then issue pull requests to us.

## Sample Brief
We've prepared [a sample of an Amicus Curiae Brief in markdown format](https://github.com/ace-ny/BitLicense-Amicus-Curiae/blob/master/sample%20brief.md) based on [a real-world brief](http://www.afer.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/12-144-bsac-KluweAyanbadejo.pdf).
